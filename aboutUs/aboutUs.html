<p id="question">What kind of Driver's License do I need in order to rent a car in the U.S.?</p>
<p id="answer">
The only Driver License (driving permit) accepted to rent a car in the U.S. (up to 15 passengers) is your original and official driver's license from your 
country of residence, along with your passport. The drivers license must be valid for the entire rental period.The International Driving Permit by itself 
will not be sufficient to rent a car, since the International Driving permit is only considered to be a translation of the original National License, and 
although it is recommended, it is not required.

<p id="question">Are these rates guaranteed or will I have to pay any additional charges other than the amount on my confirmation voucher?</p>
<p id="answer">
In order to guarantee the promotional rates listed below, we strongly recommend completing the reservation as soon as possible. These promotional 
rates are subject to change without previous notice and will only be guaranteed once the reservation is confirmed. There are no mandatory charges 
in addition to the amount shown on your confirmation voucher, however, upon vehicle pickup, the rental agent may offer additional services and 
insurance coverages, as well as vehicle category upgrades. Such services are optional and shall be refused by the customer if not interested. The 
non acceptance of such optional services does not impede the customer from renting the vehicle. Carefully read the rental contract before signing 
to make sure that only requested services have been included, because once any optional services have been accepted the total rental charges will 
be altered and no amounts will be refunded.

<p id="question">What are the age requirements for renting a car?</p>
<p id="answer">
In order to rent a car in the United States and Canada, and qualify for these promotional rates, the renter must be at least 21 years of age, have a 
valid driver’s license from the country of residence (non-U.S.), and a major credit card in his/her name. The minimum age for renting a car in the 
United States is 21. However, drivers between the ages of 21 and 24 will be charged an underage fee of U$ 35.00 p/day in addition to the regular rental 
charges.
